# Polynomial Bayes' Rule

This Python code demonstrates how to represent and compute Bayes' rule using polynomials. Bayes' rule provides a way to calculate conditional probabilities between events. We also include functions for representing discrete distributons as polynomials and working with probabilities using basic algebra. There's more advanced functions for computing characteritic functions of probability distributions using the discrete-time Fourier transform.

## Usage

To compute Bayes' rule using polynomials, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies, such as SymPy, using `pip` or any preferred package manager.

2. Define the polynomial representations for the probabilities involved: P(A), P(B), and P(B | A).

3. Use the `bayes_rule` function, providing the polynomial representations as inputs.

4. The function will compute the polynomial representation for P(A | B).

5. Print or further analyze the resulting polynomial, which represents the conditional probability P(A | B).

Here's an example usage:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly

def bayes_rule(p_a, p_b, p_b_given_a):
    x = symbols('x')
    p_a_given_b = Poly((p_b_given_a * p_a) / p_b, x)
    return p_a_given_b

# Example usage
x = symbols('x')
p_a = Poly(x**2 + 2*x + 1, x)
p_b = Poly(2*x + 3, x)
p_b_given_a = Poly(3*x + 4, x)

p_a_given_b = bayes_rule(p_a, p_b, p_b_given_a)
print("P(A | B):", p_a_given_b)

## Philosophy of Algebraic Data Analysis

There are various ways to represent discrete probability distributions as polynomials. Multiplying polynomials corresponds to convolution of probability disttributions. We can also represent probability distributions uniquely using Fourier transform. you can perform powerful data analysis using basic algebraic operations corresponding to convolutions.
